# XamarinMvvm

### Mvvm framework built for Xamarin forms application. 


1. Provides ViewModel Navigation
2. Auto wire (Setting Binding context) for view
3. Cusomizable Navigation Containers
4. Contains built-in IOC
5. Easy to Adopt

If we want to implement mvvm based architecture, First thing is our logic should not involve the views and also Views should be independent of Navigations. With this in main focus this Framework is built. 

This contains Built-In IOC container based on TinyIoc which is super lite, dependency injection is done through constructor injection.

ViewModel logic Unit Testable

To get started, It is as easy as in default Xamarin.Forms applications, Very minimal confgurations required.
