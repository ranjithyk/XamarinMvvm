# XamarinMvvm

### Mvvm framework built for Xamarin forms application. 

When we are implementing mvvm based architecture first thing to fallow is, our **Logic** should not involve the **Views** and **Views** should be independent of Navigations. With this in main focus this Framework is built. This contains Built-In IOC container based on TinyIoc which is super lite, dependency injection is done through constructor injection. ViewModel logic is Unit Testable.

### Main Features
1. Provides ViewModel Navigation
2. Auto wire Binding Context for view
3. Provides Built-In and Cusomizable Navigation Containers
4. Contains built-in IOC
5. Easy to Adopt and very minimal configurations
6. Customizable setting Binding Context logic (used during Auto-Wiring)

To get started, It is as easy as in default Xamarin.Forms applications, Very minimal confgurations required.
